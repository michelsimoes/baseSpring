# SUBMODULES

# [EFCommons](https://github.com/michelsimoes/edeploy-EF/tree/master/EFcommons)
Name of the main project, it receives the module version and import parameters required for all processes.
EFCommons: Path containing common configuration and parameterization files in the project for more than one module to use, it will contain common encryption keys, data shared by the systems as well as configuration and access to all databases, gateways and APIS applications. will make use of.

## [Force-rest-api](https://github.com/michelsimoes/edeploy-EF/tree/master/force-rest-api)
Module designed to manage the SalesForce connection, with parameters, token generation, validation and api connection.
In addition to handling session data and token generation safely by the application, this module is also responsible for doing 'syntax conversion', which is responsible for translating conventional SQL statements generated by systems to salesforce (SOQL) language, thus proposing ease of future technology migration from the current ERP to SQL queries, with only changes in connector parameters.

## [EFBatch](https://github.com/michelsimoes/edeploy-EF/tree/master/EFbatch)
A standalone application created using SpringBatch, which aims to use the paths EFCommons and Force-rest-api, to process automated routines, without physical interaction to start or suspend processing, and the interval between processes can be determined by user.

## [EFPainel](https://github.com/michelsimoes/edeploy-EF/tree/master/EFpainel)
Web application that will centralize all user interactions and graphical management of data and processes.
Also making use of the project auxiliary paths for entity access and data queries, this module is subdivided into layers (MVC) and the model responsible for mapping data entities, the visual layer, responsible for all user experience, screens, patterns. and graphical features and the control layer, responsible for the application's business rules.

## 
Thus, with layer decoupling, scalability and maintainability as well as portability are maintained in all application layers, from data layers to visual layers.
